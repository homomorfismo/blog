My education:

- I graduated in mathematics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
- I studied one semester of the Master's in Mathematics at Universität Bonn.

Some of my hobbies are:

- math (duh),
- museums and theatre,
- books ([goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/homomorfismo)) and movies ([letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/miguelsxvi/)), 
- role-playing games and board games,
- debating, I used to do it with the university debate club.
