This is Miguel Serrano. I'm a math undergradute at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.

Some of my hobbies are:

- not being able to disconnect from math-related content,
- sharing videos on YouTube (my channel is in Spanish, though),
- museums and theatre,
- reading (see if you like what I read, I share it on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/homomorfismo)),
- role-playing games and board games,
- debating, I used to do it with the university debate club, but right now I'm not much into competing.
